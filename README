			CorrelationPlus
A Python script to plot dynamical correlations for proteins.

CorrelationPlus is a script that you can use to plot dynamical
correlations for proteins and biological macromolecules. These
correlations can be dynamical cross-correlations or linear mutual
information. 

This program is more useful if your structure containts multiple
chains. The program will produce an output for overall structure 
and all individual intra-chain correlations, if exist. Moreover,  
the program will give you inter-chain correlations, if you have 
more than one chain. 

The program only requires a pdb file and a correlation data. 
The correlation data has to be in matrix format, where only A(i,j)
values are listed in a square matrix format.
